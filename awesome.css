I'll need to see both your HTML and CSS code to correct errors and provide a working solution. Please provide the complete code, and I'll assist you further.

If you don't have the HTML code, please provide more details about the structure you're trying to achieve, such as:

1. Header with navigation
2. Main content area
3. Footer with social media icons

I'll create a basic structure and correct the CSS accordingly.

Let's get started!
